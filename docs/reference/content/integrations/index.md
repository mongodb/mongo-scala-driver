# Integrations

The `Observable`, `Observer` and `Subscription` implementation draws inspiration from the [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) and [reactive streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org) libraries and provides easy interoperability with them.  For more information about these classes please see the [quick tour primer]({{< relref "getting-started/quick-tour-primer.md" >}}).

## Reactive Streams

{{< img src="/img/mongoReactiveLogo.png" title="RxScala" class="align-right" >}}

The [Reactive streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org) initiative provides interfaces that allow reactive stream based systems to interact. The API is similar to the MongoDB `Observable` API but without the composability of the MongoDB implementation.  
 
Converting from an `Observable` to a `Publisher` is a simple process and can be done in a few short lines of code. An implicit based conversion can be found in the [examples folder]({{< srcref "examples/src/test/scala/reactivestreams">}}).
